 * This class is intended to give some customization points to wolfJSSE
 * for users who want to hard-code certain limitations for wolfJSSE in terms
 * of protocol version support, cipher suite list, or native wolfSSL
 * SSL_NO_* type options.
 *
 * Most users will want to take other approaches to limiting these features,
 * as this approach will require modification of this class and a
 * recompilation/reinstallation of the wolfJSSE JAR file.
 *
 * Currently these limitations are enforced upon invocation of the
 * WolfSSLContext.init() method (createCtx()).
