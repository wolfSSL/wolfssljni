 * wolfSSL TLS 1.3 Secret Callback Interface.

 * <p>
 * To use this interface, native wolfSSL must be compiled with
 * HAVE_SECRET_CALLBACK defined.
 * <p>
 * After implementing this interface, it should be passed as a parameter
 * to the
 * {@link WolfSSLSession#setTls13SecretCb(WolfSSLTls13SecretCallback, Object)
 * WolfSSLSession.setTls13SecretCb()} method to be registered with the native
 * wolfSSL library.
