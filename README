wolfSSL JNI

This package provides a Java, JNI-based interface to the native wolfSSL
(wolfSSL) API. It provides Java applications with SSL/TLS support up to the
current TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2 standards.

Note 1)
The java.sh script uses a common location for the Java install location.
If your Java install location is different, this could lead to an error
when running java.sh. In this case, you should modify java.sh to match
your environment.
